1.DEFECT TRACKER-

Project idea-we often repeat the minor mistakes made by others while building a software which results in bugs. The goal of this project is to identify those mistakes while a project is being built by which those minor defects can be prevented.

We have a dataset which consists of more than 200,000 entries of data on the reported bugs of Mozilla Firefox and eclipse, we can use this to train our machine learning model which identifies the kinds of defects upcoming projects might have. We can even use various datasets to train our model to make it useful on other domains.

We propose to develop a model which lists out bugs which a developer might face in future based on his project. He can rectify those in the initial stages of his project.

2.TA EVALUATOR-

Project idea- professors generally get a lot of requests for an assistantship. Our goal is to make the selection process easier for a professor. Our idea is to develop a model which would be trained with the performances of previous teaching assistants to predict the performance of the current applicant.

We found a suitable dataset which consists of required information about previous teaching assistants and their performance which would enable to rank all the requests received to the professor.

3.ADD ACCEPTANCE-

Project idea-there are many advertising companies developing adds everyday, but they wonâ€™t know if their add will be accepted by their employer untill they actually show it to him. We propose a model which would tell if their employer would be satisfied or not.

We have a dataset which consists of previous datas of farm adds and their acceptance from the owners, this can be used to train the model which will make it capable enough to give good accurate predictions.
