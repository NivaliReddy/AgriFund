1. BUG DETECTOR

Project idea- As developers, we often make mistakes while trying out new codes that might have already been fixed by someone else and end up wasting a lot of time fixing something that has a fix. The goal of this project is to identify those mistakes in the early stages using the dataset which consists of more than 200,000 entries of data on the reported bugs of Mozilla Firefox and Eclipse. 
We can further train our machine learning model with various datasets to make it useful on other domains.

We propose to develop a model which lists out bugs that a developer might face in future based on his project. He can rectify those in the initial stages of his project.

2. TA EVALUATOR

Project idea- Professors generally get a lot of requests for an assistantship. Our goal is to make the selection process easy for a professor. Our idea is to develop a model which would be trained with the performances of previous teaching assistants to predict the performance of the current applicant.

We found a suitable dataset which consists of required information about previous teaching assistants and their performance which would enable us to rank all the requests received to the professor.

3. AD ACCEPTANCE

Project idea- There are many advertising companies developing ads everyday, but they wonâ€™t know if their ad will be accepted by their employer until they actually show it to him. We propose a model which would tell if their employer would be satisfied or not.

We have a dataset which consists of previous data of farm ads and their acceptance from the owners. This can be used to train the model which will make it capable enough to give good accurate predictions.

4. Track the Trap

Project idea- Poaching is a huge issue that has come into light with rise in environmental problems. Although illegal, poaching has been around for ages and inspite of allocating a lot of resources, they aren't being put to optimal use. We would like to develop a system that can read data about previous poaching activities, entrapment locations and other such data to predict possible poaching strips where the activity maybe carried out on a bigger scale so the resources can be allocated efficiently.

Dataset- Not found yet.
