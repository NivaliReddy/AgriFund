	ABSTRACT


AgriFund:

24.6% of Indian population are farmers. Even to this day, with all the technological advancement, Indian agriculture is still plagued by several problems. Farmers do not have enough resources. They depend on rains for farming which are highly unpredictable which gives rise to the need for canals, borewells and other such provisions. On the other hand, funders are not aware of farmers issues. Thereâ€™s not enough funding and even funds that have been raised do not reach the farmers. Crowdfunding solves the problem of raising enough funds for farmers but lacks financial transparency. Donors have to accept risk of fraud and misuse of funds. For creating a transparent system for this issue, we combine crowdfunding and blockchain technology.

Crowdfunding is a form of alternative sourcing that can be used to raise funds by collecting small amounts of money from a large number of people, usually over the internet. Blockchain is a way of aggregating and sharing information that can either be made transparent or not, based on the requirement.

Our system: 
The app will allow creation of farmer groups based on geography, verify authentic farmers & donors. Farmers can list their problems, requirements and approximate funds needed. Funds will be raised using crowdfunding and farmers provide receipts of utilization of funds that have been allocated.  Donors and farmers will have access to see the flow of funds from origin to the end with a donation ledger that keeps track of the flow of funds. This will help create accountability and accessibility between individuals and organizations. Donors will know the impact of their money. It creates a perfect environment of digital trust without having a centralized authority to maintain the system.
